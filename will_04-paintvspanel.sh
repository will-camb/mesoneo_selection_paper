## Just like the previous 03 run, this is the painting of moderns vs the panel
## There are R scripts that then do the mixture modelling which will be sent separately

bash will_paint_withinpanel-b.sh full `pwd`/will_modernvsancient will_modernvsancient.cp

## I think you:
## Run this
## Do the jobs it gives you
## Run it again to combine the output
## Clean up if desired
